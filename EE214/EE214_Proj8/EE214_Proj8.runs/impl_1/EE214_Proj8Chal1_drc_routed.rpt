2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net bcdClk_0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin bcdClk_0/o_divClk[3]_i_3__0/O, cell bcdClk_0/o_divClk[3]_i_3__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net bcdClk_1/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin bcdClk_1/o_divClk[3]_i_3/O, cell bcdClk_1/o_divClk[3]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net bcdClk_2/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin bcdClk_2/o_divClk[3]_i_3__2/O, cell bcdClk_2/o_divClk[3]_i_3__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT bcdClk_0/o_divClk[3]_i_3__0 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
bcdClk_1/o_divClk_reg[0], bcdClk_1/o_divClk_reg[1],
bcdClk_1/o_divClk_reg[2], bcdClk_1/o_divClk_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT bcdClk_1/o_divClk[3]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
bcdClk_2/o_divClk_reg[0], bcdClk_2/o_divClk_reg[1],
bcdClk_2/o_divClk_reg[2], bcdClk_2/o_divClk_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT bcdClk_2/o_divClk[3]_i_3__2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
bcdClk_3/o_divClk_reg[0], bcdClk_3/o_divClk_reg[1],
bcdClk_3/o_divClk_reg[2], bcdClk_3/o_divClk_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
