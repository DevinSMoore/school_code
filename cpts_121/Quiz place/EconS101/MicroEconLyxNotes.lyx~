You only have so much time, money, or things to do.
 As a consequence you must choose where to spend it (cost/benefits)
\end_layout

The opportunity cost of an item - what you must give up to get it - is its

If I specialize in Engineering & someone else specializes in Farming.

 to produce the thing I specialize in, and then tradethat for the food I
 need.

Markets move toward equilibrium because people respond to insentives.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
New line at supermarket opens up during rush.
 People will then flood to that spot because they can benefit from that.
 Once the new line fills up there is no reason to change what line you're
 in.
 Therefore this system is in equilibrium.
